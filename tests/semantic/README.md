# SENS-owned semantic tests

These are executable language-owned semantic witnesses, not host-language
semantic oracles.

`d1-d3-control-law.bits` contains only exact-width 0/1 domain words plus D2
framing. Correct D1/D3 semantics reaches exact D1 `1`. A wrong ATOM, EQ, or
COND decision routes into an intentionally non-callable D1 head so SENS itself
rejects the witness.

`d1-d3-control-law.sens` is the canonical physical T5 form of exactly those
words.

Rust, Python and shell are allowed to transport bytes, invoke SENS, and retain
evidence. They do not define the expected logic of this witness.
