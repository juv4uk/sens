//! Width-safe domain carriers over the shared small-word mechanism.

//! These newtypes separate domain membership at the Rust type boundary without
//! assigning semantic meaning to individual bit patterns. SENS contracts own
//! orientation and role tables; this module owns representation only.
//!
//! Different domains do not implicitly interchange:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use sens::{Bija3, Bit2, Racana2};
//!
//! let structure = Racana2::from_word(Bit2::new(0b01).unwrap());
//! let _: Bija3 = structure;
//! ```
//!
//! Predicate answers are not host booleans:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use sens::PredicateBit;
//!
//! let _: PredicateBit = true;
//! ```
