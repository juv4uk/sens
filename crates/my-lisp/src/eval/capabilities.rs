//! capabilities.rs - the registration point for host capabilities.
//!
//! The canonical core ships ZERO host capabilities: no filesystem, no
//! processes, no sockets. What it ships instead is this registry: a host
//! adapter (the `my-lisp-host` crate, a WASM shim, an embedder) may
//! install named special forms at startup. Until something registers a
//! name, evaluating it falls through to ordinary function application
//! and fails `UnknownSymbol` like any other unbound name - the same
//! fail-named discipline as everything else (S2).
//!
//! This makes "capability-free core" physically true rather than a
//! policy statement: the OS-touching code lives outside this crate, and
//! a build that never calls the installer cannot reach it.
