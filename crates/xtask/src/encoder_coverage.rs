//! #176 (MACHINE-ISA-3): generate a deterministic, per-ICLASS encoder
//! coverage manifest from #175's admitted XED evidence.
//!
//! This module is a transport/normalization mechanism only, exactly like
//! xed_import. It never invents encoding facts: for every ICLASS admitted
//! by lib/machine/xed/generated/machine-evidence.lisp it emits either
//! `partial` (an existing Lisp encoder in lib/machine/encoding/x86-64.lisp
//! covers at least one real form of that ICLASS) or `not-yet-implemented`
//! (an explicit, justified gap) -- there is no third, silent outcome. The
//! `partial`/`implemented` ICLASS set is a small curated Rust table kept in
//! sync with the actual encoder by a Rust integration test; this module
//! does not decide what counts as "implemented" on its own.
